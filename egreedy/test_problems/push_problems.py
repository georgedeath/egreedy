"""Real-world robot pushing problems: push4 and push8.

push4 is the "4-D ACTION" problem from [1]_, a four-dimensional robot pushing
task in which a robot has to push and object to an unknown target and receives
feedback, after completing its task, in the form of the distance from the
pushed object to the target. The robot is parametrised by its initial
location, the angle of its rectangular hand (used for pushing) and the number
of time-steps it pushes for.

push8 is an extension of the push4 problem in which there are two robots
pushing to targets to unknown target locations. The robots can block each
other and therefore the problem will likely be much harder than the push4
problem.

Each problem class, once instantiated can be directed called, eg:
>>> f = push4(t1_x=4, t1_y=4)
>>> x = numpy.array([-4, -4, 100, (1 / 4) * numpy.pi])
>>> f(x)
array([3.75049018])

Additional parameters can also be specified to allow the visualisation and
saving of the robot pushing problem. Assuming the function as be instantiated
as above, a dictionary named "plotting_args" can be passed during the function
call, e.g. f(x, plotting_args) to facilitate plotting. Its keys are as follows:
    'show': bool
        Whether to show the pushing problem.
    'save': bool
        Whether to save the shown images - also needs 'show' to be True.
    'save_dir': str
        Directory to save the images to. It must exist and be set if saving.
    'save_every': int
        N'th frame to be saved; e.g. if set to 10 every 10th frame gets saved.
    'save_prefix': str
        Prefix given to the saved filenames - useful when saving multiple runs.

Note that once initialised (details in each problem definition) the problem
domain for each problem is mapped to [0, 1]^D because the time-step parameter
(in [0, 300]) is an order of magnitude larger than the initial robot position
(in [-5, 5]) and hand orientation [0, 2*numpy.pi].
